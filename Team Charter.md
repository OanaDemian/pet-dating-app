We are team Jaguars

Nothing is set in stone all subject to change

Bearing in mind the EQ learning we’ve done with Dana and elsewhere, we want to foster a good team to work in

Project Management too: Jira Software

Sprint Duration: 2 days 
Staying in the pairs
We plan to meet
At 10:15am for morning standup
At 5pm for a Sprint End retro at the end of the day

We value:
No obigligation to work after 5:30pm
Honesty
Being communicative
flexibility
Compassion
learning
(in that order)

We will have a nominated leader/spokesperson which will rotate daily

When we are upset we will raise it immediately in the Slack channel, separating the facts and the story as far as we are able, and giving actionable, specific and kind feedback as appropriate.

##Pairing: 
1. Vertical slice
  Frontend Testing, React, CSS, Model, Express Route, Backend Testing
2. 2/3 days working on a particular feature

Time Off: 
1 hour minimum self led learning
Taking breaks while pairing
Lunch breaks decided in pairs

## Final Project goals

### Testing
- [ ] 90% or greater test coverage.
- [ ] Unit tests:
  - [ ] test one piece of your own logic.
  - [ ] fail if that logic breaks.
  - [ ] pass if it that logic produces the expected result.
- [ ] You can articulate why any test exists (or does not exist).
- [ ] Every feature is tested from the user's perspective.

### Good distribution of work
- [ ] Your team co-owns the code. Every member of the team can:
  - [ ] explain _why_ any part of the application exists (what user need it solves).
  - [ ] explain _how_ any aspect of the application works.
- [ ] Every member of the team has made commits.
- [ ] Every completed ticket has a closed (or merged) Pull Request.

### Quality of work
- [ ] Commit messages are clear and composed of:
  - [ ] a single line describing the changes made.
  - [ ] a description of the problem it solves, with reference to the user.
- [ ] The linter passes on all commits.
- [ ] All commits have a low complexity score.
- [ ] All pull requests are peer reviewed.

### Documentation
- [ ] There is up-to-date documentation:
  - [ ] a project description.
  - [ ] how to install and run it.
  - [ ] how to run tests.

It's also a great idea for your team to keep some sort of record of your learning process.  This could take the form of a blog, a wiki or any other format you like.

## Additional Criteria – Weeks 8 and 9 (Engineering Projects)

- [ ] Merging any branch into `main` automatically deploys after passing automated tests.
- [ ] `main` is deployed into production.
- [ ] All code on `main` is containerised. (optional)
